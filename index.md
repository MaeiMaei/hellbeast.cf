## Hello world.

Hey, if you're reading this, I'm probably gone for a while. This is very difficult to type retroactively, but I suppose I'm used to that. 

## What's wrong?
Honestly, quite a lot despite so little. I feel like I've personally stagnated with myself, not getting anywhere and not really feeling as satisfied with myself. I hope this isn't a shock to people. I've just not been okay, often overwhelming to talk to people about.

I've been boiling with unjustified anger and frustration over the last few weeks and I'm afraid of snapping that at someone.
This often introduces a lot of friction between me and other people, especially people I am close with or people who wouldn't be able to take that.

I'm hoping gaining some time for myself gives me appreciation for talking with other people again.

I'm not resigning from the internet entirely, I'm sure this will shortly blow over, but please don't look for alternative accounts for mine. Please just give me a break, I'll be back in just a moment.

For now though, MaeMae is dead. 
Digitally. Who knows.

Here's a Tasque Manager to lighten your mood if I wrecked it, I tend to do that.
