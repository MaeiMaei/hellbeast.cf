I'll just write these down here since there might be people who stalk this page because they love me that much.
Or you know, they're just chronically insane.

Yes you. Nerd.


# 2022-10-02

Zerotier Network Access Control is now public.
Changed Lust page to reflect that.

# 2022-10-03
Using German Unity day (Tag der deutschen Einheit) to broadcast a message for the oppressed people of Iran.
Down for that day with a embedded Youtube player similar to the landing page pre-Limbo.

Added Meta tags for Discord, links should now embed with info in them. Might expand as much as I need to.

Made the Tasque Manager loop since they're so cute that you should watch them twice.
