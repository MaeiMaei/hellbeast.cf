# Entering Lust
**I don't really care** if you badly need help or just want to chitchat, you can text here if I know you.

## Networking and Zerotier
First off, download [Zerotier-One](https://www.zerotier.com/download/). It's a software-defined network that allows you to connect to me.

The steps differ here depending on OS,
For Windows: Search Zerotier, open it, click the orange icon on the tray and connect to `52b337794f67c301`

For Linux: Run `zerotier-cli join 52b337794f67c301`
For Android: Open the app, press the plus in the top right, input `52b337794f67c301`

You should now be allowed into the network immediately. 

## XMPP

Open your preferred XMPP client ([here if you don't got one](https://xmpp.org/software/clients/), I use Gajim).
Register an account with an account name that ***I CAN IDENTIFY YOU WITH*** at `lust.hellbeast.cf` (yourusernamehere@lust.hellbeast.cf), if I don't recognize you or you don't register an account after a good while, I'll boot you since you might as well be red teaming.

If you're connected, you can contact me by contacting
`maebeast@lust.hellbeast.cf`
or
you can join the public XMPP chat in
`public@refuge.lust.hellbeast.cf` ([protocol link](xmpp:public@refuge.lust.hellbeast.cf?join))

If you can't connect to the server, I might not be around or awake. Try another time or contact me per email [here](mailto:mameaeiscutegirl@gmail.com).

# Technical details

For the tech nerds,
I've set up client isolation for the Zerotier Network, but I cannot guarantee anything within there. I recommend you keep your systems up to date and with proper security precautions.

DS-Lite is torture in 2022 and I beg any German-speaker to support and promote the EU proposal at https://futureu.europa.eu/processes/Digital/f/15/proposals/764
It's a plaque because of how cheap it is and prevents ordinary people like you and me from hosting at home.

The XMPP server ***does not support s2s due to technical limitations, DO NOT CONNECT PER S2S, CONNECT DIRECTLY.***
