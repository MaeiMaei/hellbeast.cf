# Welcome to my personal hell :)

Hi, I'm MaeMae! I'm a transgender woman that therapizes people without license and creates small projects in my freetime.

My interests are system administration and programming as well as needlessly reinstalling operating systems.
I have some intermediate knowledge of Python and Debian-based Linux systems. 
Though I've recently switched to Arch and find it delightful with KDE c:

I like to chitchat with other people and be on the bleeding edge of tech, even with the headaches that come with that.

# This page
I'm a bit lazy and you might know this theme and page for when I took a small break off the web, I'm looking to rework this when I can but jekyll-theme-console is the theme I'm most comfortable with running at the moment.

HellLine is for now retired and I thank everybody for the interest and kind regards!
